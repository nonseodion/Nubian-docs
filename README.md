# Nubian Introduction

Nubian simplifies Decentralized Finance \(DeFi\) for the average crypto user. All the basic DeFi activities including swapping, lending, borrowing, liquidity provision, staking and yield farming are made easily accessible on a simple user interface. 

Nubian makes interactions with DeFi no different from interacting with a simple bank application. It leverages different platforms in the background to come up with a simple and easy to use interface for everything DeFi. Newbies and degens alike can monitor their portfolio and earn with ease, we handle the difficult parts and make the DeFi experience sweet☺. 

To make all these and more possible you have to create a smart contract account called a **DeFi Smart Account \(DSA\)**. The smart account is used to manage all your investments it's like a bank account but far better because you have absolute control of it. It protects your crypto assets and at the same time gives you limitless access to the DeFi ecosystem.

### 🔄Swap

Swaps are one of the most basic features of DeFi. You can swap your tokens on Nubian. Your swaps are routed through a decentralised exchange and you are given the token you desire. You are able to see the number of tokens you would get before the swap is initiated, the exchange rate and can select different percentages of your token balance to swap.

### 💸 Lend

Start earning interest on your tokens by lending them. You can lend any amount of tokens and withdraw them with interest at any time. The interest rates are very high compared to what the bank gives you for lending your money to their customers.

### 🤲 Borrow

Want more of a token? You can borrow different amounts of a token using another token as collateral. You earn interest for providing collateral and can borrow an amount dependent on the value of the collateral you have provided. You can pay back the borrowed tokens at any time and collect your collateral.

### 💰 Stake

The staking feature allows you to stake the Nubian tokens \(NBN\) and earn interest in Nubian tokens.

### 🌊 Liquidity Provision

Earn interest in swap fees by providing liquidity to any of the trading pairs on any Automated Market Maker \(AMM\) we support. This allows you to earn a part of the swap fee anytime someone makes a swap using the pair you provided liquidity. Pancake swap is a typical example of an AMM.

### 🚜 Yield Farm

Yield farming allows you to earn even more interest after [providing liquidity](./#liquidity-provision) to a trading pair on any AMM. When you provide liquidity, you are given liquidity provider \(LP\) tokens to track the amount of liquidity you provided. These LP tokens can be used to earn more rewards by staking them in a farm \(a pool for staking LP tokens to earn rewards\). You are given an interest in another token. The interest can also be compounded.
