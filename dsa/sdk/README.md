# SDK

The SDK helps developers easily connect with DeFi by leveraging the Nubian Finance ecosystem without having to worry about writing a single smart contract. Imagine being able to swap, lend, borrow, farm and stake with minimal knowledge about the Binance Smart Chain. The SDK allows developers to do exactly that.

Traditional web2 developers can simply install the SDK and do all the popular DeFi activities and even so much more as more connectors are added. We encourage you to add any connector you feel should be among the list of available connectors but isn't there. Check [how to add a connector](../connectors/how-to-add-a-connector.md) to go about it

The SDK is available for browser and Node environments.
